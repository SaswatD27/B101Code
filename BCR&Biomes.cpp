  cout<<"2. Africa. A hot, poor continent lying both in the Southern and Northern Hemispheres. Due to its weaknesses and lack of wealth, it is quite easy for diseases to spread there. As a result, there is a 15% chance at the beginning of the game that your initial BCR will be decreased by 1 for the rest of the game as a starting value. Don't forget to bless the rains down in Africa. "<<endl;

As a result, because of choosing South America, there is a 25% chance that after being eradicated once by humanity, there is a 25% chance you will be revived for 10 more turns."<<endl;
  cout<<"4. North America. A rich, varied continent. On account of its vast swathes of unclaimed terrain and its low population density relative to other parts of the world, its effect is that every time you spread to a new biome on a continent, there is a 5% chance that you will spread to another biome as well."<<endl;
  cout<<"5. Oceania. A continent primarily swallowed by the ocean, the lack of interconnectivity between the discrete land points requires a disease to have a strong resistance to the unforgiving forces of nature's biomes. Hence, there is a 15% chance that all biome weaknesses are neglected for the duration of the game for any disease beginning its journey here."<<endl;
  cout<<"6. Asia. The largest of the continents and also the most geographically diverse, any disease here must be prepared to take on a large number of people and a shocking variety of conditions. So, like a good disease should, there is a chance to bring about future mutations, both good and bad to really test whether you can cut it or not. Hence, for every mutation you receive, there is a 25% chance that you will receive another mutation."<<endl;
